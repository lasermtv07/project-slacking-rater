## 1) What the fuck?
If you're like me, you often get a little discouraged working on your billion dollar side project. If youre *really* like me, you often create another fifty side projects and all are there sad and abandonned. Well, this CLI tools will put end to it!
Upon running in your project directory, it will give you *"encouraging"* messages to motivate you in working on it. I suggest you do it since a hidden file is located within the repository and if u dont, it will send your location to NKVD and you will be arrested.
## 2) Why the fuck?
Honestly, I was *really* bored and didnt have anything else to do (i mean i had but i didnt feel like doing it so i didnt) so I made this! Beautiful innit? Yes the code is kinda terrible but it was my first "big" (not really) bash script so it atleast taught me some bash. That counts ;). And yeah, I know the days measure isnt so accurate, because of months with 31 days and february and shit. I chose I dont care since getting it count properly would be pain.
## 3) How do I use it?
The program has positional arguments - the first argument is the path to the project folder. This is if u wanna call it from your bashrc for some reason or something. The second argument is essentially `-s` or nothing or something else.
If `-s`, which stands for shut the fuck up, is specified, then it wont print the actual rating quotes but instead it will print the.. "rating score" and file name. Oh yeah. The quotes are as follows
- Good job! *(0-14)*
- Laazy *(14-30)*
- Do something you FAILURE! *(30-80)*
- Off to GULAG! *(>80)*
